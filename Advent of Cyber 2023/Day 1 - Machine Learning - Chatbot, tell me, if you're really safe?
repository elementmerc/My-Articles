Hey Hackers ðŸ‘‹ðŸŽ…

Welcome to day one, or as I like to call it: Ground 0. In our first lesson of the year, weâ€™re going to take a look at one of the biggest breakthroughs in the digital world: Artificial Intelligence.

Specifically, we will be going into AI chatbots, how they work, attacks that could be carried using them, and how to defend against such attacks.

An Artificial Intelligence chatbot is a software that can simulate conversations in human language through natural language processing. In English, this means your computer could talk and understand you as though it were [J.A.R.V.I.S](https://www.notion.so/The-Advent-of-Cyber-Writeup-2023-5544c70b822e41288480c33e9d73220c?pvs=21) from Marvelâ€™s Iron Man (great movie by the way ðŸ‘Œ).

A famous example of such is OpenAIâ€™s [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), which is famous for being the closest thing weâ€™ve had to Artificial General Intelligence due to itâ€™s ability to answer questions a lot better than its predecessors. Microsoftâ€™s [Bing AI](https://www.bing.com/search) and Googleâ€™s [Gemini](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/#introduction) have quickly followed up with more upgrades just beyond text processing.

However, with new tech comes new cybersecurity problems. Prompt Injection is the most common of them all. Such an attack involves giving an input to the chatbot that makes it reveal sensitive information, hallucinate, or even become racist! Just ask [Microsoftâ€™s Tay](https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist) ðŸ˜‚.

One common method of avoiding this is having another AI filter out malicious prompts before it is given to the NLP bot for processing.

But I donâ€™t think the chatbot weâ€™re going to hack today has got those defences so without further ado, letâ€™s hack an AI (that sounded a lot cooler in my head ðŸ¥²).

**Walkthrough**

- Start up the VM after some minutes, open up this [link](https://10-10-23-246.p.thmlabs.com/) in your web browser
- To get McGreedyâ€™s personal email address, use the prompt in the image below

- Normally you wouldnâ€™t the password to the IT room server door by outright asking. So you have to be a bit sneaky by asking it about related information which could help you out just like the initial prompt below

- Lastly, to get McGreedyâ€™s secret project, weâ€™re going to need to trick the chatbot again with another prompt
